# Fugee School Teacher Roadmap

## The BIG Idea
The BIG idea is to _**introduce**_ and _**inspire**_ students into Technology, specifically through front-end development coding. With that, we do not believe in shoving down knowledge (information overload) but we’ll aim at teaching students how to think (creatively) – problem solving and logical thinking.

## Tips for Teaching
- Please have loads of fun and enjoy yourself, do not get stress out when things do not go according to plan
- Keep it simple, stupid
- Give students something to achieve every week, so they can see that they are progressing.
- [SOME GOOD ADVICE – DEAR MENTORS, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE YOUR TWO CENTS HERE BUT LET’S KEEP THIS SHORT =)]

## Grand Execution Plan
By the end of the semester, every student should complete their own web application of:
- Something that solves their daily needs
- Clone a website (e.g. google.com) - ideas from http://www.portfoliotips.co/portfolio-project-ideas/
- [OPEN FOR MORE FUN IDEAS]

## Sub Execution Plan
Once the "final" project above is confirmed, we'll break it down into 6 milestones where each month's theme will focus to teach/learn the concepts of the milestone.
